    <p>The original Latin word universitas refers in general to 
        "a number of persons associated into one body, a society, company,
         community, guild, corporation, etc".[7] At the time of the emergence of urban 
         town life and medieval guilds, specialized "
         associations of students and teachers with collective legal rights 
         usually guaranteed by charters issued by princes, prelates,
          or the towns in which they were located" came to be denominated by this general term. 
          Like other guilds, they were self-regulating and determined the qualifications of their members</p>
